We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.

## Personal Data Controller

The term "Personal Data" as used in this policy, describes information that can be associated with a specific person and can identify that person. Personal Data does not include information that has been aggregated or anonymized so that a specific person can no longer be identified. Any reference to "Personal Data" in this Privacy Notice includes without limitation "Personal Data" as defined by the Data Protection Act 2018.

A Personal Data controller is a person or organisation who controls the collection, holding, processing or use of Personal Data, including a person or organisation who instructs another person or organisation to collect, hold, process, use, transfer or disclose Personal Data on his or her behalf.

## Types of Personal Data Collected

The types of Personal Data that we may collect from you or through third parties will depend on our interactions with you and may include:

- Financial information such as your wallet addresses;

- Transaction information such as the wallet addresses of senders and recipients of Digital Assets, activities on the Deshop Platform, your inquiries and our responses;

- Usage Data which can include your IP address, your country of origin, the features of the browser or operating system utilised by you, how you use the Deshop Platform, among other identifiers;

- Other personal data or commercial and/identification information that we, in our sole discretion, may deem necessary to comply with various applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

We may also collect Personal Data about you from third parties and other sources such as publicly available sources of information.

We collect this information from you when you freely provide it on the Deshop Platform or when you use the Deshop Platform. We may also collect your Personal Data from third parties or publicly available sources as noted above.

Unless specified otherwise, all Personal Data requested by us is mandatory and failure to provide this Personal Data may make it impossible for you to access or use the Deshop Platform. In cases where the Deshop Platform specifically states that some Personal Data is not mandatory, users are free not to communicate this Personal Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Deshop Platform. Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory may contact us for clarification.

## How We Share Personal Data

We may share your Personal Data with our service providers and vendors to assist us in providing you with the Deshop Platform. We do not share your Personal Data with third parties without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Notice or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. We may share your Personal Data within our group, and with affiliates, for purposes consistent with this Privacy Notice.

We may share your Personal Data with third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Site or our business. These third parties may use your Personal Data only as directed or authorised by us and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any other purpose. We may also share your Personal Data for compliance purposes.

We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets, including your Personal Data, in connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganisation or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution.

## Retention of Personal Data

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. We determine data retention based on the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from an unauthorised user, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.

Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between you and us will be retained until such contract has been fully performed. Personal Data collected for our legitimate interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfil such purposes.

We may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever you have given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, we may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, Personal Data will be deleted (or, where permitted under applicable law, may be de-identified instead). Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability (where relevant under applicable law) cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.

However not all your Personal Data may be able to be deleted or de-identified; see the section of this Privacy Notice on "Blockchain transactions", below.

## Privacy Technology Practices

### Links to Third-Party Sites

The Deshop Platform may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites, mobile applications and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Data. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.

### Data Security

The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We employ a number of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Data we collect. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We ask you not to share any of your personal security information.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to the Deshop Platform. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk.

### Blockchain Transactions

Your use of digital assets may be recorded on a public blockchain, in particular the settlement of your trades in digital assets. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to re-identification of transacting individuals and the revelation of personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.

As blockchains are decentralised or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by us, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data on such networks.

### Overseas Disclosure and Your Privacy Rights

For purposes of relevant data protection legislation, Deshop is the Personal Data controller. Deshop is a company with operations throughout the world. As a result, Personal Data may be transferred outside the country in which you reside for the purposes identified. Any such transfer of Personal Data shall take place under applicable law and will be protected through international data transfer agreements where necessary that have been recognised by relevant data protection authorities as providing an adequate level of protection to the Personal Data we process. By using the Deshop Platform you understand that your Personal Data may be processed in the United States and outside of the EEA and the UK.

Residents of the EEA and the UK are granted certain rights over their Personal Data, which include:

- The right to obtain confirmation of the Personal Data we process.

- The right to rectify inaccurate Personal Data that we process.

- The right to request erasure of your Personal Data, subject to exceptions provided under the law.

- The right to restrict certain processing of your Personal Data, so long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of or in relation to a contract or service to which you are a party.

- The right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format

- The right to object to the processing of your Personal Data, including the right to object to automated decision-making and profiling.

- The right to withdraw your consent where you have previously given it for the processing of your Personal Data

You are generally entitled to access Personal Data that we hold about you. If you request access to your Personal Data, in ordinary circumstances we will give you full access to your Personal Data. Depending on the nature of the request, we may charge for providing access to this information, however such charge will not be excessive. However, there may be some legal or administrative reasons to deny access. If we refuse your request to access your Personal Data, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal where we are required by law to give those reasons.

Complaints: If you feel that we have not respected your privacy or that we have conducted ourselves inconsistently with this Privacy Notice, please contact Support and advise us as soon as possible. We will investigate your queries and privacy complaints within a reasonable period of time depending on the complexity of the complaint. We will notify you of the outcome of our investigation.
