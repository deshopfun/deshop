## Personal Data Controller

The term "Personal Data" as used in this policy, describes information that can be associated with a specific person and can identify that person. Personal Data does not include information that has been aggregated or anonymized so that a specific person can no longer be identified. Any reference to "Personal Data" in this Privacy Notice includes without limitation "Personal Data" as defined by the Data Protection Act 2018.

A Personal Data controller is a person or organisation who controls the collection, holding, processing or use of Personal Data, including a person or organisation who instructs another person or organisation to collect, hold, process, use, transfer or disclose Personal Data on his or her behalf.

## Types of Personal Data Collected

The types of Personal Data that we may collect from you or through third parties will depend on our interactions with you and may include:

- Financial information such as your wallet addresses;

- Transaction information such as the wallet addresses of senders and recipients of Digital Assets, activities on the Deshop Platform, your inquiries and our responses;

- Other personal data or commercial and/identification information that we, in our sole discretion, may deem necessary to comply with various applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.

We may also collect Personal Data about you from third parties and other sources such as publicly available sources of information.

We collect this information from you when you freely provide it on the Deshop Platform or when you use the Deshop Platform. We may also collect your Personal Data from third parties or publicly available sources as noted above.

Unless specified otherwise, all Personal Data requested by us is mandatory and failure to provide this Personal Data may make it impossible for you to access or use the Deshop Platform. In cases where the Deshop Platform specifically states that some Personal Data is not mandatory, users are free not to communicate this Personal Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Deshop Platform. Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory may contact us for clarification.
